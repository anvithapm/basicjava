My notes for this session:

OOPs is short for Object Oriented Programming. Java is based on these principles.

The first principle of encapsulation is putting related properties and actions together in a class. By using the word 'private'in front of a method, you would not be able to call the method. This is the second part of encapsulation, hiding the details.
