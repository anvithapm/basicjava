Here are my notes for this session:

Methods are actions. The syntax for a method is:
  1. Ask for method name
  2. Ask for inputs
  3. Ask for what it gives back
If the data type is not returning anything, then put void at the beginning of the line. (EX: void doHomework). If it is returning something, put return, then the number or word after. (EX: int readBook ~enter~ return 10).
When you are writing a method, you are writing instructions, and grouping them with a method. In methods, use (), and provide input inside them.
A constructor is a special method, it has the same name as the class, it does not have return data type.
