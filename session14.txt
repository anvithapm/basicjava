My notes for this session:

Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name at the same time, if their argument lists are different.
Data type 'char' is used for storing a single character.

A java project contains:
- Multiple classes
  - A class contains:
      - variables
      - constructor
      - methods
      - A method contains:
        - instructions
Method body: body is the part which begins with { and ends with }. All instructions should go here.
