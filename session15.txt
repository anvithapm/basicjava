Here are my fifteenth session notes:

Constructor overloading is the same thing as method overloading, but with a constructor. A constructor is called a constructor because you can only use it to create an object, and not any other time.
Defining a method includes: name, inputs, instructions, and outputs. Calling the method is asking to follow the instructions given.
When calling the method in the same class, you can just use the method name and any parameters.
Hiding the details using 'private' is a part of encapsulation. Encapsuation is hiding the details, and packaging related things.
