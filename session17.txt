My notes for this session:

Recap of variables:
- they are one word
- define variable before using it
- cannot define multiple variables in same method
- variable is alive when defined, and dead when it sees a flower bracket "}"
- can define the same variable in different methods
- use lowercase firt then uppercase (EX: readBook)
