My notes for these sessions:

Methods that do not have any class variables can be converted into static methods. They can be used in 2 ways: creating object then calling it, or call in the class itself. Once you make a static, it doesn't exist in the object anymore, it is part of the class.

Add special: remembers previous total and adds it to the input

Reuse 1: use Java Developer Kit (JDK)
Reuse 2: second principle of OOPs is inheritance. If you type "extends methodName" one class can have the same variable as the class you extend it to.
